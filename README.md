As an Undergraduate Research Developer at **NOVA**, I am focused on advancing the autonomous capabilities of **Hail-Bopp**, our self-driving vehicle. My work involves utilizing **ROS2** and **Docker** to ensure seamless communication and integration between the vehicle's autonomous components, contributing to the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the system.

**YOLOv8 for Brake Light Detection** üö¶:  
I successfully trained and evaluated a **YOLOv8** model to detect brake lights on vehicles in diverse conditions such as sunshine, rain, snow, and varying viewing angles. The model was also designed to handle edge cases, including detecting when brake lights are off in a vehicle with no lights at night. This project harnesses **AI** and **Machine Learning** techniques in **computer vision**, allowing the vehicle to reliably assess brake light status in real-time, improving safety and enabling adaptive decision-making in complex driving environments.

**Dynamic Occupancy Grid System** (Current Task) üó∫Ô∏è:  
I am currently working on implementing a **dynamic occupancy grid** system for **Hail-Bopp**. This system will enhance the vehicle‚Äôs ability to perceive and navigate its environment by dynamically updating the grid with real-time data from the vehicle‚Äôs sensors. The occupancy grid will allow **Hail-Bopp** to track obstacles and navigate through complex environments, improving its situational awareness and safety in dynamic driving conditions. This task involves advanced integration of sensor fusion, mapping algorithms, and real-time data processing to create a more responsive and adaptive autonomous system.
